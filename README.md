# fighterproject-monogame
Note: There are missing files from the full project. 
This is because some files are too big to be uploaded to github. Luckily these files are mostly dlls, xnb, etc. 
This repo is NOT intended to be downloaded or edited. It is meant to show the code of the functional and important classes of this project.
Thank you for your understanding.
